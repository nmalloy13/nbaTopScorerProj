# nbaTopScorerProj

In this project, we'll be investigating NBA teams and how reliant they are on their top scorers. Often, we see teams having to choose between a strategy that focuses on stopping a team's best scorer or stopping their supporting cast. My goal is to find which teams/players are most/least reliant on their top scorer to see how teams should be game planning defensively. We'll be taking NBA data from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eoinamoore/historical-nba-data-and-player-box-scores?resource=download) and doing some EDA before diving into some modeling.
